    Among the files recovered from the drive, one image stands out—an old photo, seemingly harmless.
    But you’ve learned by now: nothing she leaves behind is without purpose.
    It’s not the photo that matters.
    It’s where it was taken.
    Hidden deep beneath the surface, a strange code pulses—something she didn’t erase. Or maybe… she wanted it found.
    A place tied to Harley.
    A location once whispered about, never confirmed.
    Her hideout? Or just another breadcrumb?
