    Gotham is restless. Sirens echo. Screens flicker with headlines: "The Joker... Gone?" 
    No bodies. No notes. Just a lingering laugh caught in the wind.
    But this isn’t one of his usual games. Something’s off. And the only clue left behind? A single image file—sent anonymously.
    Some say it’s just a photo. But the Joker always hid his secrets behind a smile.
    Maybe that’s your first clue...
