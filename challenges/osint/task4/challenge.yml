    While searching through the remains of the Joker’s last known hideout, you stumble across a half-burned hard drive—cracked, chaotic, and smeared with lipstick.
    Just one word is scrawled on a sticky note stuck to the side:
    “He left pieces behind. I turned them into games,enjoy...”
    At first, it looks like corrupted junk. But inside, something waits.
    A folder. Locked tight.
    Files wrapped in layers of puzzles—each more twisted than the last.
    Every file you open, every code you break, brings you closer to the truth she wants you to see.
