    The location from the photo led you somewhere real—an abandoned lot, scorched walls, and a single charred locker tucked beneath rubble. 
    Inside it, sealed in a plastic sleeve, was something unexpected:
    A crumpled boarding pass.This wasn’t just a ticket. It was part of her escape. Maybe even a final message.
    One number on it stands out. Not a seat. Not a gate.
    Something traceable. Something real.
    She didn’t run without leaving clues.
    She wanted you to follow.

    Track the trail she left in the sky.
    Find where it ends.
