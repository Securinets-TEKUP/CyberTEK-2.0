    You thought the trail ended with that video.
    But as the static clears, one lone comment stares back at you—simple, out of place.
    A name you don’t recognize.
    It doesn’t belong there… and yet, it feels intentional.
    The Joker always had followers. Admirers. Puppets. But this one’s different. 
    This name shows up in places it shouldn’t. Again and again. Someone’s watching. Or maybe… guiding.
    They say true identities are hard to hide on the internet.
    Start with the name. Follow the echoes.
